## What The Icons In These Documents Mean

## :heavy_check_mark:  
This check mark icon flags places for you to record actions you have taken. Check them off as you go!

## :rocket:  
This rocket icon represents the overall difficulty rating for a checklist item. One star items should be doable by most technology capable organizations. Items with two stars may require some outside assistance and work flow shifts. Three stars will require significant organizational commitment of resources and technical assistance. Items with four stars are only for organizations ready to take on advanced security practices, including the ongoing commitment of human and other resources needed to make them effective.

## :wrench:    
This wrench icon represents the amount of technical skill needed to undertake the practice. One set of tools means most skilled computer users can do, or be trained to do, the task. Two wrenches require “power user” technical skills, often found in the “Accidental Techie” on staff. Three wrenches will require a technical support person to do the work. Four wrenches means you will need a technical support person with significant skills in networking or security to undertake the practice.

## :fire:  
This flame icon represents the amount of work flow disruption taking on this task entails, and consequently how much staff time for documentation, training and work shifts is required. One flame items will be mostly innocuous and staff can be trained in a brief session. Two flames means the practice will require more training and can disrupt existing work flows dramatically. Three flames signals that significant work flow shifts and training will be required to undertake the practice. Four flames means the task will disrupt work flow completely and is only for organizations where security is of far greater importance than efficiency or convenience.
