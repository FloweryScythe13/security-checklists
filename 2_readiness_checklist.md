# Digital Security Readiness Checklist
## Introduction
This checklist contains baseline, ongoing information systems and technology practices that it is recommended your organization already have in place in order to successfully take on a digital security initiative. If you cannot check off more than 75% of the items in the list below, it is recommended you focus on meeting these baselines before proceeding with other digital security work. Even if at 75% or above, be sure to note the unmarked items and make plans to implement them as soon as possible, as not doing so will likely undermine your security efforts.

## Digital Security Readiness Tasks

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Have regular and adequate technical support provided either by staff assigned via job description or contracted with outside agencies.**  
*If your existing hardware and software are not well supported, introducing new tools and practices will likely meet with significant barriers, as new technologies and tools often demand significant ongoing technical support for proper setup and functioning. There are as many ways to secure technical support as there are organizations. Talking to peer organizations in your area is a good way to find quality help.*

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Have a culture of training and learning, including strong technology training and follow up as part of new staff orientation procedures.**  
*New tools and practices demand end user training. If your organization doesn't have established practices around training, implementing improved and possibly complex secure practices is nearly impossible. Beginning with documentation and training for new hires is a wise first step in this area. Following up with new employees at 30 day intervals will ensure they continue to get the support they need to do their work effectively and securely.*

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Have a common and clearly communicated set of information systems that all staff use effectively.**  
*If your staff are using personal file-sharing, email, task management, or other accounts without knowledge or guidance from the organization, not only will your efficiency suffer but the environment becomes impractical to secure. How can you protect things you have no access to at an administrative level or, worse yet, don't even know are in use?*

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Have a recurrent line item for technology in your budget**  
*Security is an ongoing process and will require ongoing investments in computer equipment and software to be effective. Work with your technical support provider to determine an appropriate amount to put into this line item.*

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Provide relatively new and adequately powered computers to all staff**  
*Industry standard best practice is to replace laptops and desktops every 3 to 5 years. Encryption tools use a lot of power and can bring older, inadequately powered computers to a near halt, making some security steps untenable for staff. Money for replacing 1/3 to 1/5 of your computers each year should be part of your recurring technology budgeting.*

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Have some baseline non-technical security practices**
*If you do not control your office space and access to your computers, your other digital security steps can be easily circumvented by walking into your office. Rotate alarm system codes, door codes, wireless network passwords and other sensitive access procedures such as emergency building access when staff leave the organization.*

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Make sure the computers and other devices you use, including personal devices that staff may use to access organizational information, are not compromised by malware, viruses or other intrusive software.**  
*As a first step, ensure you are running antivirus software on all computers. Antivirus software for Macs and Windows computers is available to non-profits at a discounted rate through [Tech Soup] ("http://techsoup.org"). If you haven't been running antivirus software or otherwise aren't sure about the status of your devices, you can have the operating system (OS) on it reinstalled to help guarantee
the computer is free of malware and viruses.*

*If reinstalling, use a copy from the OS provider wherever possible. Computer manufacturer often bundle other software in their installs which may impact privacy and security but may also contain specific tools for the hardware (especially in laptops). There are other ways in which your devices can be compromised at a low level which cannot be remedied by an OS reinstall. If your computers have been handled by third parties you don't trust, out of your possession in a hostile environment or you suspect intrusion by powerful or well resourced entities, get a new computer and call a security professional.*

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Have a disaster recovery plan that includes making regular backups of organizational data that are stored away from your main offices. Do not rely exclusively on third parties to back up and hold your information.**  
*This actually is a digital security practice itself, but straightforward and critical enough that it needs to come before any other digital security steps. Talk to your technical support provider about the status of your backups. Refer to [this guide] ("http://www.techsoup.org/disaster-planning-and-recovery") for ideas on how to  improve your disaster preparedness.*

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Have a process for properly onboarding & offboarding staff and volunteers that includes attention to your information systems.**
*The expansion or contraction of your team is a critical change in your security context, and so is an important moment to institute strong security measures. Your onboarding process should include detailed steps for the creation of accounts and instructions on how to determine and grant of the correct and minimum of permissions needed for that person to work. When a staff member or volunteer departs, ensure that any of the organization's data that is on their personal or work devices is copied and/or destroyed as necessary. Also at offboarding, all personal accounts of the departed person should be deleted and any organizational passwords that they used or accessed in their work should be changed to something new.*
