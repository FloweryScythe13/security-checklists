# Introduction  
The documents in this repository comprise a set of digital security checklists for use by US based non-profit organizations with a focus on human practice and organizational management. One checklist is oriented towards assessing an organization's readiness to take on this type of work. Additional documents represent framing information and a glossary.  

**They are not appropriate for use in other countries without a thorough review and update to reflect conditions in that environment. It is not our fault if you do not heed this important concern, but would be happy to discuss updating the content in this way. [Contact us?]("https://iecology.org/contact")**

**Our gratitude for these humans and organizations working on the front lines of important change making work is immense.**
